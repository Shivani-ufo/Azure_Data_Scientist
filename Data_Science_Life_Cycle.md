## Five Major Stages of Data Science Lifecycle

### it's typically iterative process consists of following five Stages

#### Business Understanding

_"Without a well defined start and end place. how will we know the way to ourdestination?"_
	Define Objectives - 
		Define using five question types
			Regression
			Classification
			Clustering
			Anomaly Detection
			Recommendation
 
	Identify Datasources

		Identify relevancy
		Determine accuracy

#### Data Acquisition and Understanding

	Produce a clean. High quality data set
	Create and efficient data pipeline

	**Ingest the Data**

		Azure Blob
		SQL Database
		Hive Tables

	**Explore the Data**
		We cant train what we don't understand
		Eliminate noise
		Audit data quality

	**Set up Data Pipeline**
		Streaming vs batch
		Orchestration

#### Modeling
	
	Determine optimal data features
	Create a machine learning model

In this stage we create an informative machine learning model that most accurately predicts the target.

	**Feature Engineering**
		Create Features from raw data
		Select the key subset of oringinal data features

	**Model Training**
		Split input data
		Build the model
		Evaluate the training and data set


#### Deployment
	
	Deploy the model with a data pipeline to a QA environment

Upon completing the third stage , the newly created model needs to be operationalized.

	**Operationalize** - expose the model with an open API interface


#### Customer Acceptance
	
	Finalize the Project Deliverables

In this final stage. we finalize the project deliverables.

	**System Validation**

		Confirm that the deployment model and pipeline meets custom needs,

	**Project Hand-Off**
	
		Deploy into productionn
