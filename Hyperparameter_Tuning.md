## Hyperparameter Tuning### Why hyperparameter?Machine Learning is an academic field with its own particular terminology. Data scientists refer to the values determined from the training features as parameters, so a different term is required for values that are used to configure training behaviour but which are not derived from the training data - hence the term hyperparameter.The choice of hyperparameter values can significantly affect the resulting model, making it important to select the best possble values for your particular data and predictive performance goals### What is Hyperparameter Tuning?In machine learning, models are trained to predict unknown labels for new data based on correlations between known labels and features found in the training data. Depending on the algorithm used, you may need to specify hyperparameters to configure how the model is trained. For example, the logistic regression algorithm uses a regularization rate hyperparameter to counteract overfitting; and deep learning techniques for convolutional neural networks (CNNs) use hyperparameters like learning rate to control how weights are adjusted during training, and batch size to determine how many data items are included in each training batch.
