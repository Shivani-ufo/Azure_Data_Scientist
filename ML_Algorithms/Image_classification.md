## Image Classification**Where do we look in Azure to find this?**
1) Remember Azure Machine Learning Designer!2) Classification3) Neural networks4) So this is a Multiclass Neural Network module		Computer vision	Document classification	Pattern recognition


### CNN
Can be used to analyze visual imagery.Frequently the behind-the-scenes actor inimage classification.
