- Two-Class Averaged Perceptron- Two-Class Boosted Decision Tree- Two-Class Decision Forest- Two-Class Logistic Regression- Two-Class Neural Network- Two-Class Support Vector Machine#### Multiclass Classification
- Multiclass Decision Forest- Multiclass Logistic Regression- Multiclass Neural Network- Multiclass Boosted Decision Tree


### But How Is It Used?
Credit card risk: The Two-Class Boosted DecisionTree can be used to monitor credit card risk.Classic Titanic problem: The Two-Class DecisionForest can be used to predict survival rate basedupon the circumstances and demographic data.
